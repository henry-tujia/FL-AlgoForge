# FL-AlgoForge

üìö **Federated Learning Repository**

A repository for implementing and reproducing classic federated learning methods. This project allows for fast training by leveraging multiprocessing to launch client processes. It supports both local training on clients and centralized server aggregation with customizable operations, making it highly extensible.

## Installation

üîß Use the following steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/henry-tujia/FL-AlgoForge.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd FL-AlgoForge`
3. Install [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) and initialize the project: `pip install hatch&&hatch new --init`
4. Switch Python environment: `hatch shell`.
5. Install  and dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

üöÄ Follow the steps below to quickly get started:

1. Set the dataset directory in `configs/datasets/cifar10.yaml` (recommended for quick start with Cifar10).
2. Launch training using multiprocessing: `python main.py method=fedavg models=resnet8`.
3. Check the results in the `logs` folder or use wandb to track the results.


## Usage

üìò Detailed instructions on how to use the repository:

1. Configuration: Customize the settings by changing the YAML files in the `configs/` directory. These files contain parameters and federated settings that can be adjusted to fit your requirements.

2. Dataset Partitioning: To implement custom dataset partitioning, modify the dataset code in `src/data_preprocessing/${dataset}/data_loader.py`. This file handles the data loading process, and you can modify it to support your desired data splitting method. Currently, it supports partitioning client subdatasets based on the dataset's indices (`idxs`).

3. Algorithm Customization: To customize the algorithm, you can inherit from the `Base_Client` and `Base_Server` classes defined in `src/methods/base.py`. By inheriting from these base classes, you can make the necessary modifications to tailor the algorithm to your specific requirements.

Please refer to the respective files and directories mentioned above for detailed instructions, and make the necessary changes according to your needs.
